"""Packs: units of scan coverage that can be shipped and installed separately.

A pack bundles everything one area of Azure needs -- its checks, their
cleaners, the rate specs that price them, and the fetchers that refresh those
rates. The checks that ship in this package are themselves packs (``core``,
``aks``), loaded by exactly the same path as one installed from PyPI, so the
seam is exercised on every run rather than only by third parties.

A third-party pack declares itself with an entry point::

    [project.entry-points."zombiescan.packs"]
    acmecorp = "zombiescan_pack_acmecorp"

and calls ``register_pack`` at import time, before registering its checks::

    from zombiescan.packs import register_pack
    register_pack("acmecorp", version="1.2.0", description="ACME's own waste checks")

**A pack is code, and it runs with your Azure credentials.** Nothing here
sandboxes it or verifies that its checks are read-only; install packs you
trust, on the same judgement you would apply to any other dependency.
