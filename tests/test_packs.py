The pack seam is only worth having if it is the same seam a third party would
use. These tests treat the built-in packs as ordinary packs and check the
things that would silently break a marketplace: a pack that claims another
pack's name, one built against a different API version, one that fails to
import, and a rate key that two packs both answer to.
